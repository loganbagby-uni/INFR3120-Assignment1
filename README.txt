**Viewport Dimensions:**
Mobile (max-width: 600px)
Chosen for smartphones and small mobile devices. This breakpoint captures most mobile phones where vertical navigation and smaller images improve usability and touch interaction.

Tablet (601px - 1024px)
Chosen for tablets and small laptops. This range accommodates iPad-sized devices and provides a middle ground between mobile and desktop layouts with moderate spacing and element sizing.

Desktop (1025px and above)
Chosen for large screens and desktop monitors. Users have ample screen space, so content is centered with maximum widths for optimal readability, and hover effects enhance the experience.

**Gradient Usage:**
Linear Gradients (left-to-right and top-to-bottom):

Page headings (h1): linear-gradient(to right, #4a5568, #6d7a94, #8693ab)
Navigation bar: linear-gradient(90deg, #4a5568 0%, #6d7a94 50%, #5a6578 100%)
Navigation hover: linear-gradient(to bottom, #3d4557, #4a5568)
Submit button: linear-gradient(to right, #6d7a94, #8693ab)

Angular Gradients (135-degree diagonal):
Body background: linear-gradient(135deg, #919AA3 0%, #6d7a94 50%, #a8b2c0 100%)
Project cards: linear-gradient(135deg, #d4dde8 0%, #b8c5d6 100%)
Button hover: linear-gradient(135deg, #4a5568, #6d7a94)

**Color Scheme:**
Scheme Type: Monochromatic (Blue-Grey)

Palette:

#4a5568 (Dark slate blue)
#6d7a94 (Medium slate blue)

I chose a monochromatic blue-grey scheme for a professional appearance suitable for my portfolio because I thought it looked good and it was also the first one I got when I randomized it. Blue is also my favourite color.
