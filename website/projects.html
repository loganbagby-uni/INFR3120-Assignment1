                <h2>Python Banking App</h2>
                <p>In this project I built an app in Python that simulates how a mobile banking app would work.
                    It had features such as: creating & deleting accounts, logging in to an account, deposit & withdraw money,
                    and check account balances. I created this bank app for a final assignment in a year 1 class.

                <h2>Network Simulator</h2>
                <p>In this project me and my group were given a network topology and were tasked to build
                    it in cisco packet tracer, once built we had to add the correct configurations that would allow
                    different networks to be able to communicate with eachother.

                <h2>Vowel Counter</h2>
                <p>This is another project that was built in python. I asked the user for a string
                    of characters, the program I built would then take the input and return however many vowels
                    were in the string. If there was no vowels it would return "No vowels!".

                <h2>Simple Calcualtor</h2>
                <p>I built this project in highschool in Java, it was a simple calcualtor that would
                    ask the user for two or more numbers. Once the user enters all the numbers he is prompted
                    with what operation he wants to do with them, and then once he selected the operation
                    it would return the result.
